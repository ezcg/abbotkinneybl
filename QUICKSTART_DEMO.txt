You must have installed on your host machine:
    Docker and docker-compose
    Git
    Setup HTTPS on your host machine with mkcert. I've installed mkcert on Ubuntu and on MacOS. On Ubuntu, you have to first install Linuxbrew:
        Ubuntu:
            sudo apt-get install build-essential curl git python-setuptools ruby
            git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew.git ~/.linuxbrew
            And then add the following to your .bash_profile:
                export PATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/bin:$PATH"
                export MANPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/man:$MANPATH"
                export INFOPATH="$HOME/.linuxbrew/share/info:$INFOPATH"
            At the command prompt enter:
                . ~/.bashrc
            Run `brew update` TWICE like so:
                brew update && brew update
            Install mkcert:
                sudo apt install libnss3-tools
                Info:   https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert
            Run brew doctor and fix all the warnings:
                brew doctor
            Finish up with:
                brew install mkcert
                mkcert -install

        On MacOS, install mkcert with homebrew
            https://brew.sh/
            Run with:
            brew install mkcert
            mkcert -install

- Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/ezcg/abbotkinneybl.git

- First time bringing up Docker locally, on the HOST machine in abbotkinneybl/nginx/bash directory, run:

    cd abbotkinneybl/nginx/bash/

    bash runmakecerts.sh
    For the domain name, enter:
    admin.local

    bash runmakecerts.sh
    For the domain name, enter:
    carousel.local

    Add to /etc/hosts file on your host machine:
    127.0.0.1 admin.local
    127.0.0.1 carousel.local

- In the root directory, run in your terminal on the host machine:

    cd PATH/TO/abbotkinneybl directory
    docker-compose up --build

    If this is your first time bringing it up on your host machine, you'll need to populate the db with some data.
    Run on the command line on your HOST machine:

    docker exec -it db bash -c "cd /db && bash docker_init.sh"
    docker exec -it admin bash -c "cd /var/app/current && composer update"

- Since this is for demo purposes, the keys to connecting to Twitter and other services are not included and you
won't be able to run the jobs that retrieve media. However, the above populated data is plenty to try out the admin.

- Open in your browser:

    https://admin.local
    https://carousel.local

- To exit, in a new terminal, cd into /abbotkinneybl/ and run:

    docker-compose down

- Troubleshooting

    * If docker crashes, you might end up with some corrupt mysql files that will later create permission
    issues for mysql on the next run. "PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Path/to/abbotkinneybl/db/docker/data/db/mysql'"
    To fix that, on your host machine in /abbotkinneybl/ directory run on the host machine:

    sudo rm -fr db/docker
    And then do docker-compose up again

    * If Laravel complains of permission issues, run this command on the host machine:

    docker exec -it admin bash -c "cd /var/app/current && bash clearcache.sh"

    * An issue I've experienced with brew was getting the error "fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com':
    terminal prompts disabled" and "homebrew/homebrew-dupes does not exist!"
    Run `brew untap homebrew/homebrew-dupes` to remove it.
    By running "brew untap homebrew/homebrew-EACHERROR", the errors went away.

    * If pages won't load, in /abbotkinneybl/ run on the host machine:
    docker-compose down --remove-orphans
    docker rm -v $(docker ps --filter status=exited -q 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null
    And then do docker-compose up again.

    * If you have a slow network connection, there's a chance the composer update in the admin directory might time out.
    You can rerun it from the command line on the host machine with:

    docker exec -it admin bash -c "cd /var/app/current && composer update"

    * Double check your /etc/hosts file. I pointed admin.local at my Mac and forgot and couldn't figure out why pages wouldn't load on my Ubuntu machine. Doh.

    * Gateway Timeout
    Be sure apache is running in admin container:
    docker exec -it admin bash -c "service apache2 status"
    If not, restart the container:
    docker restart admin
    Be sure composer installed all the vendor directories. I counted 48 files when I ran this:
    docker exec -it admin bash -c "ls -ltra /var/app/current/vendor | wc -l"
    If there's no vendor directory at all, you forgot to run on the host machine:
    docker exec -it admin bash -c "cd /var/app/current && composer update"

    * Your connection is not private
    I get this error when I set my Ubuntu machine /etc/hosts file to point admin.local to my Mac ip address when Mac is running this set up. However, I can call admin.local

    * Unknown database
    Something went wrong with initializing the database. Run this on the host machine and check the output:
    docker exec -it db bash -c "cd /db && bash docker_init.sh"
    It should build the db structure and then grab a zipped file from S3 and import that data into mysql.

    * Laravel should have any errors show up in the browser, but you can always check the logs:
    docker exec -it admin bash -c "tail -100 /var/app/current/storage/logs/laravel.log"

    * If all else fails, post a question to:
